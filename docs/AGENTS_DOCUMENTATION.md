## üîÑ How Delegation Works

### Intelligent Routing Process

1. **User Query Received** ‚Üí General Assistant analyzes
2. **Domain Detection** ‚Üí Identifies primary domain(s)
3. **Complexity Assessment** ‚Üí Evaluates expertise level needed
4. **Decision:**
   - **Handle Directly:** General knowledge, multi-domain, simple queries
   - **Delegate:** Deep expertise, technical complexity, safety concerns

### Delegation Communication Pattern

When delegating, the General Assistant:
1. **Acknowledges** understanding of the query
2. **Explains** why a specialist is better suited
3. **Recommends** the specific specialized assistant
4. **Previews** what the specialist can offer

**Example:**
```
User: "I'm building a React app and need to implement JWT authentication."

General Assistant Response:
"I can see you're working on authentication for your React application. 
For detailed technical implementation of JWT authentication with React, 
our Technology Assistant would be ideal. They specialize in full-stack 
development and can provide you with production-ready code examples, 
security best practices, and complete implementation guidance. Would you 
like me to direct you to them, or would you prefer I give you a general 
overview first?"
```
