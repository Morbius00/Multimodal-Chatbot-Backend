You'll know it's working when users say:

✅ "The medical information was so detailed and helpful"
✅ "It never repeats itself - every response feels fresh"
✅ "This bot actually seems to care"

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Responses seem cut off

**Solution:** Increase `maxTokens` in `src/agents/config.ts` for specific agent

Example:
```typescript
medical: {
  ...
  maxTokens: 1500, // Increase if needed
}
```

### Issue: Responses not detailed enough

**Solution:** Check that prompts are properly imported. Verify in config.ts:
```typescript
systemPrompt: medicalPrompt, // Not a string
```

### Issue: Server won't start

**Solution:** Check for TypeScript errors:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```
